## Project Overview

-   The authors consider kernel-weighted nonparametric regression when the distribution of the regressors may not possess absolute continuity with respect to the Lebesgue measure

-   They demonstrate that convergence rates are influenced non-trivially by the underlying distribution

-   In the case of absolutely continuous measures, their approach weakens the usual regularity conditions

-   They extend their analysis to encompass kernel regression with multiple functional regressors

## Setting

-   The authors consider a smooth nonparametric model with additive errors $$Y=m(X)+u,\qquad E(u|X)=0$$

-   $X$ may belong to a function space, e.g., continuous functions on a compact set, or a more general metric space

-   $X$ does not necessarily have to be a vector or a function

-   $X$ is supported on some domain in a vector or metric, semi-metric space denoted as $\Xi$

## Setting Cont.

-   The authors consider three cases:

    i.  $\Xi=\mathbb{R}^q$ (standard kernel regression)
    
    ii. $\Xi=\Xi^1$ (univariate metric space, i.e., functional regression)
    
    iii. $\Xi=\Xi^q=\Xi^1\times\cdots\times\Xi^1$ (product metric space)
