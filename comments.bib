 abstract = {In this article we prove uniform consistency of kernel estimators of a multivariate regression function under various assumptions on the distribution of the data. In addition to the usual assumptions that the data are iid and that the distribution of the regressors is absolutely continuous, we consider the cases that some regressors are discrete and the data are either stationary φ-mixing themselves or generated by a class of functions of one-sided infinite stationary φ-mixing sequences. Moreover, we demonstrate the performance of the kernel estimation method under these generalized conditions by a numerical example.},

 abstract = {We consider the problem of estimating a nonparametric regression model containing categorical regressors only. We investigate the theoretical properties of least squares cross-validated smoothing parameter selection, establish the rate of convergence (to zero) of the smoothing parameters for relevant regressors, and show that there is a high probability that the smoothing parameters for irrelevant regressors converge to their upper bound values, thereby automatically smoothing out the irrelevant regressors. A small-scale simulation study shows that the proposed cross-validation-based estimator performs well in finite-sample settings.},

abstract = {Many practical problems require nonparametric estimates of regression functions, and local polynomial regression has emerged as a leading approach. In applied settings practitioners often adopt either the local constant or local linear variants, or choose the order of the local polynomial to be slightly greater than the order of the maximum derivative estimate required. But such ad hoc determination of the polynomial order may not be optimal in general, while the joint determination of the polynomial order and bandwidth presents some interesting theoretical and practical challenges. In this paper we propose a data-driven approach towards the joint determination of the polynomial order and bandwidth, provide theoretical underpinnings, and demonstrate that improvements in both finite-sample efficiency and rates of convergence can thereby be obtained. In the case where the true data generating process (DGP) is in fact a polynomial whose order does not depend on the sample size, our method is capable of attaining the n rate often associated with correctly specified parametric models, while the estimator is shown to be uniformly consistent for a much larger class of DGPs. Theoretical underpinnings are provided and finite-sample properties are examined.}

 abstract = {In this paper we consider a nonparametric regression model that admits a mix of continuous and discrete regressors, some of which may in fact be redundant (that is, irrelevant). We show that, asymptotically, a data-driven least squares cross-validation method can remove irrelevant regressors. Simulations reveal that this "automatic dimensionality reduction" feature is very effective in finite-sample settings.},
