 abstract = {In this article we prove uniform consistency of kernel estimators of a multivariate regression function under various assumptions on the distribution of the data. In addition to the usual assumptions that the data are iid and that the distribution of the regressors is absolutely continuous, we consider the cases that some regressors are discrete and the data are either stationary φ-mixing themselves or generated by a class of functions of one-sided infinite stationary φ-mixing sequences. Moreover, we demonstrate the performance of the kernel estimation method under these generalized conditions by a numerical example.},

 abstract = {In this paper we consider a nonparametric regression model that admits a mix of continuous and discrete regressors, some of which may in fact be redundant (that is, irrelevant). We show that, asymptotically, a data-driven least squares cross-validation method can remove irrelevant regressors. Simulations reveal that this "automatic dimensionality reduction" feature is very effective in finite-sample settings.},
